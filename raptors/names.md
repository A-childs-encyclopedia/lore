Raptors operate in a hive-mind systems, the Queens controlling vast numbers of unintelligent drones. While the drones are capable of thought they are not sentient and have no free will.

While there are many different Raptor variants they are able to be grouped into several genus' and herein lies one of their strengths. Raptors within the same genus look very similar and you often cannot immediately tell the strengths, weaknesses and abilities of a given raptor until too late. To compare the forces of Raptors against Armada or Cortex is difficult at best, they lack the same force structure of bot, tank, hovercraft and such. Instead their forces would be broken up by group and air. Individual raptors are more versatile than their mechanical opponents and act very differently on the battlefield as a result.

While certain genus will exist primarily in one "tier" that's not to say all of that genus will best sit there. For example a small and otherwise weak subspecies might be more comparable to a crawling bomb that a Pawn or Grunt.

Note: Any unit definitions here are intended to be suggestions of what we should/can go with as opposed to expectations. Gameplay should dictate the types of units rather than lore.
- Majority of ground units should be able to swim/be amphibious
- Very little in the way of base structures
- all units should be able to feed (reclaim), they might lack afus plants but they can hoover up corpses very well

### Small - T1
Urg: Small and nimble, they typically fulfil role of scouts or fast moving flanking forces. 
- Boreurg, a pawn/grunt but weaker and more numerous, importantly is also amphibious
- Gaddurg, comparable to the flea but has a melee attack though it can go in shallow water
- Zoaurg, anti air unit, has slow seeking projectiles effective against bombers but too slow to catch most fighters or scouts
- Querurg, slow and tough, would fill a role between heavy T1 bot (Centurion) and T1 plasma bot
- Sisyphurg, very fast and agile, can climb cliffs and go underwater, explodes upon death (T2)

### Medium - Low T2
Deg: Approximately the size of a standard battle tank, the Deg genus are far slower than their Urg cousins but make up for it with both stronger attack and defence capabilities.
- Nodeg, light tank, shoots spines
- Mideg, medium tank, shoots bigger spines
- Ardeg, long range indirect fire spines
- Fladeg, flamethrower, similar to current one
- Chadeg, melee unit, very high speed, has knockback, if we can have directional armour then a lot of that at the front and nothing on the sides or rear

### Large - High T2
Lisk: Monsters comparable to the biggest of battle tanks
- Garabalisk, heavy battle tank
- Snarelisk, long range AA
- Mirenlisk, plasma arty
- Sekolisk, AOE paralytic shoots at a good range

### Huge - T3
Fex: The size of buildings, capable of going toe to toe with the biggest machines
- Sadjufex, good straight line speed, melee attack
- Beherfex, standard T3 fighting unit, shoots plasma
- Telefex, agile, fast moving but weaker in a straight fight than other T3. The idea is it's spammable (for a T3) and typically very good value for money

### Flying
Vore: Fast and aggresive but small and fragile, make up the faster components of raptor air forces
- Fevore, scout
- Talodore, fighter but veeeery short range, moves fast
- Cagadore, gunship style flier
- Stiggadore, suicidal flier, targets ground, sea and underwater units

Aes: Slow but steady, typically fulfil more of a bomber role
- Scarbraes, slow moving, drops light damage but high AOE bombs, T1
- Nogannaes, swift (but not fast) bomber, drops only a couple of bombs in a small area with minimal AOE
