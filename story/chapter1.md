This is the story that plays out over the campaign

- Agrippa takes Scavengers and is intending to spread them to a cluster of Armada worlds as a weapon

<!--
- Scavengers creation is the first step of the modern issue
- Cortex want to spread them to the universe (currently they're not spreading fast enough)
- There are those within Cortex that feel this is not the best way to achieve their goals allowing for core vs core missions
- Armada are having issues with a Chicken outbreak and are caught off guard
- Some from Armada think Chickens are too chaotic to allow to live, thus forming their arm vs arm missions
-->
