## Faction notes:
ARMADA: sleek, finesse, order, existence, lawfulness ARMADA unit overview
CORTEX: heavy, brutal, chaos, entropy, destruction CORTEX unit overview 
SCAV: ruthless, mindless, assimilate, deluge, error
CHICKEN: hive mind, invasive, persistent, aggressive, life, uh, finds a wayâ€¦

## Beginning
Para:
  Entropy sucks, Arm and Core are both algorithms and are looking at "beating" entropy in different ways. They may well have come from the same source but we're not certain about that and we never will be

Para:
  Armada want to delay entropy, looking for higher state of being (ascension, preserving life etc, strength through diversity)

Para:
  Characters for Armada

Para:
  Cortex want to accelerate entropy to bring on the end of existence sooner (end suffering of existence, min/maxing going the wrong way?) - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Benatar

Para:
  Characters for Cortex

#### Armada - Latin names/words
- High commander: Empyrean (latin: heaven)
- Ethical/Moral adjudicator: Mandator (latin: command), Iudex (ee-you-dex) (latin: judge)
- Infosec coordiantor: Pignus (pin-yous) (latin: security)
- Traitor: Proditone (prod - ee - t - yor - neh) latin: betrayal)

Discarded: Brutus, Proditor (traitor), 

#### Cortex - Greek mythical names
- Emperor: Catreus
- Hunter seeker: Minos
- Mad scientist: Hegesias (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegesias_of_Cyrene)
- Traitor: Agrippa 

Other names to use: Persephone (goddess of life and death), Heirocles

#### Scavs
- The unity, there are no Scavenger leaders and we should never have a perspective paragraph for them.

#### Chickens
- Queens are concious but don't communicate with others, same perspective rules as scavengers


## Middle (recent events/where we are now)
Para:
  Chickens, adaptive and invasive species (zerg?), were spread by Armada who were seeking to spread diversity, things went wrong. 

Para:
  Lay foundations for Proditone's arc.

Para:
  Scavengers Sardoth 11 event, massive battle resulted in a malformed Commander unit either a corrupted Armada/Cortex or a combination of melded minds (another min/max type error but with the aim of unifying rather than diversifying), could be a higher power or could just be cosmic rays, we'll never know this either.

Para:
  Lay foundations for Agrippa's arc. The Cortex wanting to spread them should be the inciting incident/starting point for the campaign.

<!--
- Scavengers creation is the first step of the modern issue
- Cortex want to spread them to the universe (currently they're not spreading fast enough)
- There are those within Cortex that feel this is not the best way to achieve their goals allowing for core vs core missions
- Armada are having issues with a Chicken outbreak and are caught off guard
- Some from Armada think Chickens are too chaotic to allow to live, thus forming their arm vs arm missions
