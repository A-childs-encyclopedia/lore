## Faction notes:
ARMADA: sleek, finesse, order, existence, lawfulness ARMADA unit overview
CORTEX: heavy, brutal, chaos, entropy, destruction CORTEX unit overview 
SCAV: ruthless, mindless, assimilate, deluge, error
CHICKEN: hive mind, invasive, persistent, aggressive, life, uh, finds a wayâ€¦

## Beginning
Para:
  Entropy sucks, Arm and Core are both algorithms and are looking at "beating" entropy in different ways. They may well have come from the same source but we're not certain about that and we never will be

Para:
  Armada want to delay entropy, looking for higher state of being (ascension, preserving life etc, strength through diversity)

Para:
  Characters for Armada

Para:
  Cortex want to accelerate entropy to bring on the end of existence sooner (end suffering of existence, min/maxing going the wrong way?) - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Benatar

Para:
  Characters for Cortex

#### Armada - Latin names/words
- High commander: Empyrean (latin: heaven)
- Ethical/Moral adjudicator: Mandator (latin: command), Iudex (ee-you-dex) (latin: judge)
- Infosec coordiantor: Pignus (pin-yous) (latin: security)
- Traitor: Proditone (prod - ee - t - yor - neh) latin: betrayal)

Discarded: Brutus, Proditor (traitor), 

#### Cortex - Greek mythical names
- Emperor: Catreus
- Hunter seeker: Minos
- Mad scientist: Hegesias (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegesias_of_Cyrene)
- Traitor: Agrippa 

Other names to use: Persephone (goddess of life and death), Heirocles

#### Scavs
- The unity, there are no Scavenger leaders and we should never have a perspective paragraph for them.

#### Chickens
- Queens are concious but don't communicate with others, same perspective rules as scavengers


## Middle (recent events/where we are now)
Para:
  Chickens, adaptive and invasive species (zerg?), were spread by Armada who were seeking to spread diversity, things went wrong. 

Para:
  Lay foundations for Proditone's arc.

Para:
  Scavengers Sardoth 11 event, massive battle resulted in a malformed Commander unit either a corrupted Armada/Cortex or a combination of melded minds (another min/max type error but with the aim of unifying rather than diversifying), could be a higher power or could just be cosmic rays, we'll never know this either.

Para:
  Lay foundations for Agrippa's arc. The Cortex wanting to spread them should be the inciting incident/starting point for the campaign.

<!--
- Scavengers creation is the first step of the modern issue
- Cortex want to spread them to the universe (currently they're not spreading fast enough)
- There are those within Cortex that feel this is not the best way to achieve their goals allowing for core vs core missions
- Armada are having issues with a Chicken outbreak and are caught off guard
- Some from Armada think Chickens are too chaotic to allow to live, thus forming their arm vs arm missions
-->

## Campaign - Desolate war (the story of the two main factions going forwards)
#### Arm quelling Chicken outbreak (chicken patrols, you have to go find and kill them, zero time pressure on player)
- Story: Chickens are trying to find if this is a suitable place to expand the nest
- No build
- Covers basic movement, shooting, move while shooting, repair
- If the player pushes forwards they can end the mission early by fighting all the chickens at once
- Once patrols are done for, give vision of a small nest, drop a bunch of reinforcements capable of easily overwhelming the nest, have the player attack the nest

#### Cortex gathering Scavenger commander and imprisoning him for travel (punch hole in defences, kidnap commander)
- No build
- Use Storms to push through LLTs, show LOS range mechanic
- Mention radar wobble but don't make a big deal of it, use LOS to remove wobble
- Introduce concept of two different factions

#### Arm finding a bigger nest (1 nest spawns small waves, hold out, build up a bit and then kill the nest)
- Existing factory, no new buildings
- Introduces players to building units and how the metal/energy economy works (pay for progress, not up front)
- Allows players to experiment with unit composition
- Introduces vehicles alongside bots

#### Cortex getting ambushed by their rebels
- No build
- Large force on each side (200+ units?)
- Teaches controlling larger number of units, possibly in different battlefield locations (e.g. 30s travel time from each other)
- Teaches combined arms (again)

#### Cortex needing to punch a hole in Armada defences to launch the Scavengers into a new region of space
- Introduces aircraft
- Introduces expansion (start with 3 mexes, have 3 more nearby etc)
- Enemy will build up, they have more metal to expand to so ultimately will overpower you, time is not on your side
- AI is playing defence, slowly tipping over to offence

#### Armada responding to the Cortex attack, arrives after the launch but needs to clean up to find out what happened
- Introduces Rez bots
- Probably a good time to mention radar LOS
- Starts out as a stealth mission until player amasses enough units
- No build until they find a constructor, should be completable without building (achievement?)
- To discuss: Energy supply issue (new unit def, walking solar unit, small number of solars?)

#### Armada deals with a Scavenger outbreak
- Full build mission
- Starts with small prebuilt T1 base
- Introduces T2 (maybe just the lower end units and eco?)
- Easy scavenger base, non-big-boss commander but otherwise a tech level limited scavs (never go beyond low end T2?)

#### Cortex tries to stop Armada from stunting the growth of the Scavengers (maybe T2 at this stage?)
- Full build mission
- Core T2
- Player starts with very simple base, idea is not to dictate their playstyle too much
- Armada has multiple bases, killing one opens up resources to expand to others
- Each base should have multiple ways to approach/attack it
- If you want to be cool, bypass all the bases and go straight for Armada commander in their final base (Paratrooper?)

#### Armada and Cortex forced to team up when they become surrounded by Scavengers
- Full T2 tech tree
- Player starts with 80% of the map controlled by outposts
- Introduces Nukes and Anti-nukes, they lose some outposts because no anti-nuke
- Player has both an Arm and a Core commander (if either dies they lose or if both die they lose?)
- Scavs start attacking right away, player is expected to lose outposts

#### Cortex infiltration mission to sabotage Armada defences so they can escape back to Cortex territory (nobuild)
- No build mission
- Introduces spy units
- Introduces self-destruct EMP on spy units, use it to turn off certain things to get your attack force (Pyros?) past a radar spot
- "Introduces" radar LOS
- Could introduce all terrain units (player could have built them before of course)
- Could introduce crawling bombs

#### Scavs meet Chickens, Armada must survive until reinforcements enable their escape (limited build? survival)
- Full build mission, options for expansion but good luck holding them
- Player is sandwiched between the two, introduces the idea of having to split attention
- Finally minutes of mission, scavs should get some T3 units, gives a taste of them to the player
- Scavs get a Korgoth but specifically placed so it won't get to the player in time to make them lose but if the player is doing well it'll hit their outer defences
