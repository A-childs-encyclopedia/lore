## Campaign - Desolate war (the story of the two main factions going forwards)
#### 1 - Arm quelling Chicken outbreak (chicken patrols, you have to go find and kill them, zero time pressure on player)
- Story: Chickens are trying to find if this is a suitable place to expand the nest
- No build
- Covers basic movement, ooting, move while shooting, repair
- If the player pushes forwards they can end the mission early by fighting all the chickens at once
- Once patrols are done for, give vision of a small nest, drop a bunch of reinforcements capable of easily overwhelming the nest, have the player attack the nest

#### 2 - Cortex gathering Scavenger commander and imprisoning him for travel (punch hole in defences, kidnap commander)
- No build
- Use Storms to push through LLTs, show LOS range mechanic
- Mention radar wobble but don't make a big deal of it, use LOS to remove wobble
- Introduce concept of two different factions

#### 3 - Arm finding a bigger nest (1 nest spawns small waves, hold out, build up a bit and then kill the nest)
- Existing factory, no new buildings
- Introduces players to building units and how the metal/energy economy works (pay for progress, not up front)
- Allows players to experiment with unit composition
- Introduces vehicles alongside bots

#### 4 - Cortex getting ambushed by their rebels
- No build
- Large force on each side (200+ units?)
- Teaches controlling larger number of units, possibly in different battlefield locations (e.g. 30s travel time from each other)
- Teaches combined arms (again)

#### 5 - Cortex needing to punch a hole in Armada defences to launch the Scavengers into a new region of space
- Introduces sea and hover
- Introduces expansion (start with 3 mexes, have 3 more nearby etc)
- Enemy will build up, they have more metal to expand to so ultimately will overpower you, time is not on your side
- AI is playing defence, slowly tipping over to offence
- There is a land path you can take but the sea is more direct and obvious

#### 6 - Armada responding to the Cortex attack, arrives after the launch but needs to clean up to find out what happened
- Fighting remaining Cortex units
- Introduces air units
- Introduces Rez bots
- Probably a good time to mention radar LOS
- Starts out as a stealth mission until player amasses enough units
- No build until they find a constructor, should be completable without building (achievement?)
- To discuss: Energy supply issue (new unit def, walking solar unit, small number of solars?)

#### 7 - Armada deals with a Scavenger outbreak
- Full build mission
- Starts with small prebuilt T1 base
- Introduces T2 (maybe just the lower end units and eco?)
- Easy scavenger base, non-big-boss commander but otherwise a tech level limited scavs (never go beyond low end T2?)

#### 8 - Cortex tries to stop Armada from stunting the growth of the Scavengers (maybe T2 at this stage?)
- Full build mission
- Core T2
- Player starts with very simple base, idea is not to dictate their playstyle too much
- Armada has multiple bases, killing one opens up resources to expand to others
- Each base should have multiple ways to approach/attack it
- If you want to be cool, bypass all the bases and go straight for Armada commander in their final base (Paratrooper?)

#### 9 - Armada and Cortex forced to team up when they become surrounded by Scavengers
- Full T2 tech tree
- Player starts with 80% of the map controlled by outposts
- Introduces Nukes and Anti-nukes, they lose some outposts because no anti-nuke
- Player has both an Arm and a Core commander (if either dies they lose or if both die they lose?)
- Scavs start attacking right away, player is expected to lose outposts

#### 10 - Cortex infiltration mission to sabotage Armada defences so they can escape back to Cortex territory (nobuild)
- No build mission
- Introduces spy units
- Introduces self-destruct EMP on spy units, use it to turn off certain things to get your attack force (Pyros?) past a radar spot
- "Introduces" radar LOS
- Could introduce all terrain units (player could have built them before of course)
- Could introduce crawling bombs

#### 11 - Scavs meet Chickens, Armada must survive until reinforcements enable their escape (limited build? survival)
- Full build mission, options for expansion but good luck holding them
- Player is sandwiched between the two, introduces the idea of having to split attention
- Finally minutes of mission, scavs should get some T3 units, gives a taste of them to the player
- Scavs get a Korgoth but specifically placed so it won't get to the player in time to make them lose but if the player is doing well it'll hit their outer defences

#### 12 - Armada counterattack against Cortex fortress world
- Full build mission
- LRPGs as a mechanic, both their use and working against them
- Have some hills to provide limited shelter for the attack
- Introduces Shields as a mechanic
- Have the Cortex have a single Juggernaught in the gateway to their base

#### 13 - Armada rebels have blown up some important facilities, they are currently holed up and you need to take out their fortress
- Limited build mission (not a lot of mexes/space for metal makers?)
- Use EMP units as part of the push forwards to impassible terrain
- Arm base is nearly impossible to attack directly, there's a void between you and it and it's got lots of defences
- You can use the EMP silo to disable the anti-nuke and kill the base but you don't start in range

#### 14 - ???
- Maybe have a dropdown menu to make the choice
- Maybe have a scenario where the player actions dictate the outcome and makes the choice

#### 15 - Elite T3 squad
- Based on the choice/actions of the last mission the player is either Armada or Cortex
- This will decide the units they get and the faction they play next mission
- Player starts with a small squad of T3 units
- Must destroy a bunch of bases, the initial T3 units are the "lower end" and the bases a literal pushover
- The final base should be a challenge but far from impossible, the aim of the mission is to give the player an idea of what the different T3 units do
- 2nd last base gives them at least 1 of the "higher end" units (Korgoth, Juggernaut, Bantha, Thor)

#### 16 - Faction battle
- Armada are fighting Chickens to get to the Cortex
- Cortex are fighting Scavengers to get to Armada
- They are arranged in a rhomboid layout, with the neutral faction relevant to the robot faction closest to them as below:
```
        CHICKEN
ARMADA                       CORE
                  SCAVENGER
```
- If both neutral factions exist it makes attacking the opponent very difficult
- If one dies then half the map becomes much more open and creates and avenue of attack, their location is also rich in energy and metal while being in a good position to launch an attack from
- If the player takes too long then the opposing faction will destroy their neutral opponent and get an advantage (literally, give them some free eco stuff to ensure the player likely loses etc)
- T3 unlocked, player starts with a well built base and the capability to be fighting with T2 and using some T3. Given the time constraints, an MM economy is inadvisable as by the time they get it the enemy will have taken their Neutral base.
- When the enemy takes a neutral base, in addition to the build space, they should get a massive resource bonus (Invisible lootbox?) to ensure it matters.
